                            Hi, my name is Krzysztof (Christopher) I am currently studying Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology.
                            I am a man of many interests with a head full of ideas and motivation to implement them.
                            Passionate about software development and solving problems.

                            <img src={cernPhoto} alt="cernPhoto" className="d-none d-sm-none d-md-block"/>
                            <p>
                            I have always been interested in science and new technologies since primary school.
                            My first meeting with programming took place in high school during computer science classes.
                            Since that lesson I knew that this is my future. <br/>
                            Currently a big fan of Java and Elixir.
                            My goal is to become full-stack developer by improving my skills from area of software development.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div className="third-block p-3 mt-4 mr-md-5">

                            <p>
                                Besides programming and science I have plenty of other hobbies, like swimming, video games or cycling,
                                but my biggest love is music.
                                I have been playing a guitar since high school and I am going to learn playing a piano.
                                I am also interested in music production and composition.
                                My adventure with music really improved my creativity.
